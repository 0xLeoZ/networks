## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure that you have
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
installed on your system.

## Network List Validation

If you modify the list of networks, it's crucial that the updated list aligns
with the predefined schema. For this, you can use the in-built validation
command:

```
yarn validate
```

## Running the Getters

Getters are designed to access and output the data of the network list. To
execute the getters and print their output to the console, use the following
command:

```
yarn output
```

This command will run the getter functions and display the resulting output in
your terminal.
